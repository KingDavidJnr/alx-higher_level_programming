# Test Driven Development
TDD is a software development methodology that instructs developers to write a new code, only if the automated tests have failed.

Test driven development is a process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. The software development process is then subjected to repetitive testing of all test cases. This methodology is a sharp contrast to the process of developing software first, before testing.

## TDD Cycle
* Add a test
* Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons.
* Write the simplest code that pass the new test.
* All tests should now pass.
* Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved.

TDD, is also sometime referred to as Test First Development.
